# Contributing to the project

Help and bug reports are very welcome.  The author and other contributors to the
project will do their best to address all issues in a timely manner.  To ensure that
**can** do so, the following guidelines are provided.

## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the only method for submitting [bug reports](#bug-reports)
and [features requests](#feature-requests).  Please, respect these requests:

* Be respectful.  Stay on target.
* While requests for help about xqSelect are fine, requests for help with HTML
  jQuery, Bootstrap, or general web issues belong in their own respective 
  issue trackers.  

For general help, [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com) is a great resource for coding.  Search more than post.  Chances are you'll find someone there who has asked a 
similar question, and gotten some great answers.

## Bug reports

Bug reports are welcome and encouraged.  I want xqSelect to be as bug free
as possible, thus, good reports are definitely helpful.

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Search First!** Check if the issue has already been
   reported in the Github Issue tracker.  Don't forget to search closed issues.

2. **Be up to date!** Make sure that the bug you are reporting exists in the
   current master branch.  State what version of xqSelect you're using.

3. **Include the details!** Providing your operating system, browser(s),
   jQuery version, Bootstrap version, and (in the case of mobile) type of device
   is fairly essential to solving a problem.  

4. **Include Examples!** Attach a screen shot, or make use of jsFiddle/jsBin/Bootply
   to share the bug you are experiencing.

If others cannot reproduce your bug, or don't have enough information to determine
a possible cause for the bug - they can't squash the darn thing. If you leave all
the work in discovering how, when (steps), and where (environment) the bug happens,
you aren't really contributing.

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome, however please keep in mind that xqSelect is being
kept intentionally feature-sparse to ensure a small size and wide compatibility.

## Pull Request Guidelines

As with all open source projects, please note that by contributing code to this
project, you are granting the authors of this project a non-exclusive license to
use and re-distribute your code under the current license of the project.  The
project may be re-licensed at any time at the sole discretion of the original
author.

As is also logical, any contributed code must be original work or obtained from
similarily licensed material to which the contributer has full rights.
