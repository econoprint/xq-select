  "body": "xqSelect\r\n=========\r\n\r\nThe xqSelect package is intended to make HTML5 form selects look and act the same cross browser and platform.  A jQuery plugin, CSS and Bootstrap's dropdown.js are used to style and bring additional functionality to normal select boxes.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many excellent jQuery plugins that do similar things, and credit goes to these authors for the original idea.\r\n\r\nxqSelect is differs similar plugins in a few small ways:\r\n\r\n* Intentionally feature sparse to reduce size and complications.  \r\n* Under 8KB minified - 4KB if you're only using the CSS (see below).\r\n* The original select box is still used, and is not hidden or moved of screen.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nThe documentation for xqSelect is a work in progress and will be updated as possible.  For now, please see the basic demo and usage explanation below.\r\n\r\n## Usage and Demo\r\n\r\nA basic demo may be seen on [BootPly](http://www.bootply.com/tl9ZiekMCQ).  A more complete demo should be available soon.\r\n\r\nUsage is simple:\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"xq-select\">\r\n  <select id=\"xqSelectDemo\">\r\n    <optgroup label=\"Group One\">\r\n      <option value=\"1\" data-subtext=\"First Thing\">Item One</option>\r\n      <option value=\"2\">Item Two</option>\r\n      <option value=\"3\">Item Three</option>\r\n      <option value=\"4\">Item Four</option>\r\n    </optgroup>\r\n    <option value=\"5\">Item Five</option>\r\n    <option value=\"6\">Item Six</option>\r\n    <option value=\"7\">Item Seven</option>\r\n    <option value=\"8\">Item Eight</option>\r\n  </select>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nThis does, of course, presume that you have included the distribution JS and CSS somewhere in your HTML page.  It's recommended that stylesheet go in the ```<head>``` and the JS goes just before your closing ```</body>``` tag.\r\n\r\nTo automatically switch to a native select with *most* mobile devices, include the attribute **data-mobile=\"true\"** in the ```<div class=\"xq-select\">``` tag.\r\n\r\n## Browser Compatibility\r\n\r\nOne of my biggest goals for xqSelect is cross browser compatibility.  Reports on issues with a specific browser and platform are encouraged.  See below for guidelines.  \r\n\r\nAs of this moment, it is expected that the following browsers are fully supported:\r\n\r\n| Browser  | Version | Platform | Status\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| Chrome  | ?* | Win/Mac/Linux | Supported |\r\n| Firefox | ?* | Win/Mac/Linux | Supported |\r\n| Opera | 15+ | Win/Mac/Linux | Supported |\r\n| Safari | 6.2+ | Mac | Supported |\r\n| Safari | iOS 8/9+ | iOS | CSS Only |\r\n| Chrome | iOS 8/9+ | iOS | CSS Only |\r\n| Chrome | Android 5.0+ | Android | CSS Only |\r\n| Firefox | Android 5.0+ | Android | CSS Only |\r\n| Internet Explorer | 8 | Win | Supported |\r\n| Internet Explorer | 9/10 | Win | Supported |\r\n| Internet Explorer | 11 | Win | Supported |\r\n| Edge | All | Win | Supported |\r\n\r\nThe following browser are still expected to work:\r\n\r\n| Browser  | Version | Platform | Status\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| Opera  | 11/12 | Win/Mac/Linux | Needs Testing |\r\n| Opera | 10 | Win/Mac/Linux | Unsupported |\r\n| Safari  | 5.1.4+ | Mac | Needs Testing |\r\n| Safari | iOS 6.1 - 7 | iOS | Needs Testing** |\r\n| Android Browser | Android 5.0+ | Android | Needs Testing** |\r\n| Opera Mini | All | All | Needs Testing** |\r\n| Internet Explorer | All | Windows Phone | Needs Testing** |\r\n\r\nNo intention is present to support IE7, Opera 10, Safari 4, or 'ancient' versions of self-updating browsers such as Firefox and Chrome.  \r\n\r\nMobile browsers are marked as *CSS Only* because their native selects should be used whenever possible to ensure the best user experience.  Ideally, CSS rules will still ensure that the ```<select>``` looks uniform across browsers, but when clicked the native select will take over.  See [usage](#usage-and-demo) above for how to make this happen.\r\n\r\nFor additional browser compatibility, see [jQuery Browser Support](https://jquery.com/browser-support/) and [Bootstrap Supported Browsers](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#support-browsers)\r\n\r\n\\*   Need to find the lowest version xqSelect works with.\r\n\r\n\\*\\*  Needs testing.  Only CSS components are expected to work.\r\n\r\n## Bugs and feature requests\r\n\r\nAnyone is welcome to contribute.
